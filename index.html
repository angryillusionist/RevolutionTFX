            <h1>Case #1: Corrosion resistance and rust prevention</h1>
            <p>
                Potash is a corrosive material that destroys metal through chemical reaction. In potash mines,
                air-handling units must be replaced frequently, and many only last between three and five years.
                For a potash mine in Saskatchewan, Canada, RevolutionTFX units were built with special added options.
                These included stainless steel interior liners, copper tubing and copper fin coils with ElectroFin®
                coating to help prolong the life of the equipment and protect the owner’s investment.

                            Air-side economizers save energy by supplying cooler outside air to condition the
                            indoor space. When the outside air is suitably cool and has a lower energy content
                            than the indoor space, the dampers in the mixing box can be controlled in order to
                            take advantage of the lower-energy outdoor air. Economizer configurations include
                            barometric relief, powered exhaust and powered return fans.

                            There are several configurations that will deliver the air distribution power you need with
                            a smaller footprint. These include direct drive plenum fans that eliminate the need for
                            straight duct runs and allow a variety of duct-mounting locations. You can also choose a
                            tw0-tier vertical configuration when mechanical room floor space is limited.

                            growth and transfer of airborne microbial agents using UV lighting.

                When a contractor needed an AHU in a hurry, the RevolutionTFX Quick Ship program helped them avoid
                missing occupancy timelines. The modular configuration also gave the contractor the ability to fit
                the unit in the space without making any building modifications, saving more time and money.
