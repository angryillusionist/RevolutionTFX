            <p>Potash is a corrosive material that destroys metal through chemical reaction.
                In potash mines, air-handling units must be replaced frequently, and many
                only last between three and five years. For a potash mine in Saskatchewan,
                Canada, RevolutionTFX units were built with special added options. These
                included stainless steel interior liners, copper tubing and copper fin coils
                with ElectroFin® coating to help prolong the life of the equipment and

                <p>
                    Air-side economizers save energy by supplying cooler outside air to condition the
                    indoor space. When the outside air is suitably cool and has a lower energy content
                    than the indoor space, the dampers in the mixing box can be controlled in order to
                    take advantage of the lower-energy outdoor air. Economizer configurations include
                    barometric relief, powered exhaust and powered return fans.
